Use a partitioning tool like parted to resize the partition. If you want to decrease the size from the end of the partition, you would do something like:

sudo parted /dev/nvme0n1 resizepart 2 1000GB

This assumes that your Btrfs partition is the second partition (nvme0n1p2) and you want to resize it to 1000GB. Adjust the values based on your specific setup.
