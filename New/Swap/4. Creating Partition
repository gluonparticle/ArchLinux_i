~~~Shrining the btrfs filesystem itself doesn't decrease the size of the partition~~~
~~~Use a partitioning tool like parted to resize the partition. If you want to decrease the size from the end of the partition~~~

>sudo parted /dev/nvme0n1 resizepart 2 1000GB

[/dev/nvme0n1 is the device path wherever Arch is installed]
[This is the case if you wanna shrink 2nd partition]

[If the SSD has 1TB storage, it can store 1024GB. So if I am shrinking 24GB worth of space, I'd use 1000GB]

[If you're creating Swap of 8GB use 1016GB at the end]

[Adjust the values based on your specific setup]
