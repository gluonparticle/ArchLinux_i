Use a partitioning tool like parted to resize the partition. If you want to decrease the size from the end of the partition, you would do something like:

sudo parted /dev/nvme0n1 resizepart 2 1000GB

This assumes that your Btrfs partition is the second partition (nvme0n1p2) and you want to resize it to 1000GB. Adjust the values based on your specific setup.



Shrinking a Btrfs filesystem alone won't decrease the size of the partition. After shrinking the Btrfs filesystem, you need to resize the underlying partition to reclaim the unused space.

Here are the steps to shrink the Btrfs filesystem and then resize the partition:

Shrink the Btrfs Filesystem:

bash
Copy code
sudo btrfs filesystem resize -20G /path/to/mounted/btrfs
Replace /path/to/mounted/btrfs with the actual mount point of your Btrfs filesystem. This command shrinks the filesystem by 20GB.

Resize the Partition:

Use a partitioning tool like parted to resize the partition. If you want to decrease the size from the end of the partition, you would do something like:
bash
Copy code
sudo parted /dev/nvme0n1 resizepart 2 1000GB
This assumes that your Btrfs partition is the second partition (nvme0n1p2) and you want to resize it to 1000GB. Adjust the values based on your specific setup.
