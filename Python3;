###Installing Python###
yay -S python3


~~~~To create and manage external libraries of Python, it's always recommended to use a Virtual_Environment to prevent conflict between system packages and Python libraries~~~

###Creating a folder named 'Tachyon'
>mkdir Tachyon

###Creating a virtual Environment### 

>cd Tachyon   (We change the path and create a vir_env in the folder)

###Virtual_Environment named 'Electron'
>python -m venv Electron
>source Electron/bin/activate      (To activate the Virtual environment) 

###To install Python packages now###
>sudo pacman -S python-xyz      (for xyz package name)


##To deactivate, use###
>deactivate
